# Hard Water Update: Lake Nipigon & Jesse Lake
**Date:** February 11, 2026  
**Conditions:** 22 inches of clear blue ice; moderate snow cover.

The 2026 winter season is in full swing. We are currently seeing a very consistent **Lake Trout** bite on Lake Nipigon, particularly around the rocky saddles and mid-lake humps.

### Current Tactics & Species
* **Lake Trout (Lakers):** The "Grey Ghosts" are active in 40-70 feet of water. We’ve had the most success using 1-oz white tube jigs and **Williams Wabler** spoons tipped with a bit of sucker meat. The fish are aggressive, often rising 20 feet in the water column to chase.
* **Brook Trout:** In the smaller stocked lakes and sheltered bays of the Nipigon River (where current allows safe ice), the "Specks" are hitting small tungsten jigs tipped with wax worms. 
* **Northern Pike:** Big "gators" are hanging near the remaining green weeds in 10-15 feet of water. Tip-ups with large dead ciscoes have been the ticket for 40-inch+ fish.

### Safety Note
While the main lake is solid, always stay clear of the **hydro dams** (Alexander and Pine Portage) and the main river channel where the current keeps the ice unpredictable.
