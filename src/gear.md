title: The Gear - Professional Equipment for the North Shore

# The Rig & The Tackle

In the rugged environment of the North Shore, your equipment isn't just about luxury—it’s about safety and success. I invest in the best gear in the industry so that we can fish longer, stay drier, and find fish faster.

## The Boat: 20ft Lund Pro-V
The **Lund Pro-V** is the gold standard for big-water guiding. Designed to handle the unpredictable rollers of Lake Nipigon and the expansive reaches of Lake Superior.

* **Power:** Powered by a **Mercury Marine** outboard for reliable, fast transit to the best spots.
* **Safety:** Equipped with high-gunnels, professional-grade life vests, and a full marine radio setup.
* **Comfort:** Plenty of deck space for casting and comfortable, shock-absorbing seating for those long runs across the lake.

## Electronics: The "Digital Guide"
We don't guess; we locate. My boat is rigged with the latest **Humminbird** electronics and **Minn Kota** trolling motors.
* **Side Imaging:** Allows us to see structure and fish 200 feet to the left and right of the boat.
* **Mega Live:** Real-time sonar that lets us watch how fish react to our lures—essential for deep-water Lake Trout jigging.
* **Spot-Lock:** Keeps us pinned on a precise GPS coordinate even in heavy current or wind.

## Rods, Reels & Tackle
I provide all the high-end tackle you need for your trip. If you have a favorite lucky rod, bring it along, but otherwise, you'll be using:

* **Rods:** A fleet of **St. Croix** rods, specifically tuned for everything from finesse Brookie jigging to heavy-duty Pike casting.
* **Reels:** High-speed **Shimano** reels spooled with premium PowerPro braid.
* **Lures:** A curated selection of **Williams Spoons**, **Rapala** crankbaits, and custom-tied streamers that have been proven on these waters for decades.

> **What to Bring:** Even in summer, the North Shore can be cold. I recommend high-quality rain gear, polarized sunglasses (to see those follows!), and a sturdy pair of boots.
