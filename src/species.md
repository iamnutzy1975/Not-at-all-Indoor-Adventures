# The Giants of the North

The Nipigon system is unique. The water is cold, deep, and oxygenated—perfect for trophy growth.

* **Brook Trout (Speckled Trout):** We fish the legendary Nipigon River. These aren't your typical creek trout; we're targeting "coasters" in the 5-8lb range.
* **Lake Trout:** Lake Nipigon holds monsters. We use specialized electronics to find Lakers in 60-100ft of water during summer or shallow-water casting in Spring.
* **Northern Pike:** Shallow bays of Lake Nipigon hold 40-inch "gators" that hit topwater with a vengeance.
