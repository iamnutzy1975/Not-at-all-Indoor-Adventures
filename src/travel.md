## ??? Meeting for the Trip
Most of our expeditions depart from the **Nipigon Marina**, but depending on the species we are targeting, we may meet at specific boat launches on Lake Nipigon or the North Shore. I will coordinate the exact meeting location with you 48 hours before your trip based on the latest weather and fishing reports.

> **Traveler's Note:** If you are crossing the border, ensure you have a valid Passport or Nexus card. For the latest border wait times at Pigeon River or Sault Ste. Marie, check the CBSA website.
