# Trophy Fishing the North Shore

Welcome to **Not At All Indoor Adventures**. I'm Gord, and I specialize in guiding anglers through the legendary waters of the Nipigon region. From the world-record Brook Trout heritage of the Nipigon River to the deep-water giants of Lake Nipigon, this is world-class fishing with a local edge.

## About the Guide: Gord Nuttall

I didn't just find these waters; I live them. My approach to guiding combines decades of regional knowledge with modern electronics to put you on the fish of a lifetime.

* **The Specialization:** I focus on **Trophy Brook Trout (Coasters)**, massive **Lake Trout**, and aggressive **Northern Pike**.
* **The Territory:** Based out of Nipigon, Ontario. We fish the Nipigon River system, Lake Superior's North Shore, and the "Big Lake" (Nipigon).
* **The Philosophy:** Whether we're vertical jigging 60 feet down or casting streamers in the current, my goal is to provide a rugged, authentic, and successful wilderness experience.

> "There is no such thing as bad weather in Nipigon, just bad gear and missed opportunities."

## The Nipigon Legacy: Fortress Lake, BC

While my home is the North Shore, the story of the Nipigon Brook Trout travels over 2,000 kilometers west to the heart of the Canadian Rockies. 

### A Living Time Capsule
In the late 1920s, a remarkable experiment took place. Wildlife officials transported **Brook Trout from the Nipigon River** and transplanted them into the glacial waters of **Fortress Lake, BC**. 

At the time, Fortress Lake was fishless. These Nipigon "Coasters" found an ecosystem perfectly suited to their needs—cold, oxygen-rich water and a massive population of freshwater shrimp. Because they were isolated from their original predators and competitors, the Nipigon strain thrived, growing to enormous proportions.

### Why It Matters
Today, Fortress Lake is world-renowned for producing the largest Brook Trout on the planet, with fish frequently exceeding 5, 8, and even 10 pounds. When you fish these waters, you are literally casting into a **living time capsule of original Nipigon genetics.**

As a Nipigon-based guide, I find it incredible to see how these genetics expressed themselves in the shadows of the Rockies. Check out the video below to see the sheer power of these "Mountain Specks."

### Why Fish With Me?
In an era of high-pressure fishing, I focus on low-impact, high-reward expeditions. We use top-tier gear (Lund/Mercury/Humminbird) to ensure we spend less time traveling and more time with lines in the water.
