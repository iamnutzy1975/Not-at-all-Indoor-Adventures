 # Northern Pike: Shadows in the Weeds
 
 If you want heart-stopping strikes and visual takes, the **Northern Pike** (*Esox lucius*) is your target. Lake Nipigon's sheltered bays are massive "nurseries" for trophy-class Pike, with fish exceeding 40 inches caught every season.

 ## Why They Get So Big Here
 The combination of vast cabbage weed beds and a high-protein diet of whitefish and suckers allows Nipigon Pike to reach "Gator" status. These aren't your average hammer-handles; these are thick-bodied predators.
 
 ## How We Hunt Them
 * **Topwater:** On calm mornings, there is nothing like a massive surface strike on a "Walk-the-Dog" style lure.
 * **Casting Spoons & Swimbaits:** We use large, flashy spoons (like the **Eppinger Dardevle**) or 6-inch swimbaits to trigger reaction bites from fish buried in the weeds.
 
 ### Gear Check
 When we go for Pike, we don't mess around. We use heavy-duty fluorocarbon leaders and medium-heavy rods. These fish have teeth like razors and the power to match.
