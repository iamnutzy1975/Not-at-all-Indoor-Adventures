# Nipigon Walleye: The Gold Standard

While the Nipigon region is famous for trout, the **Walleye** (*Sander vitreus*) fishing here is some of the most consistent in Northern Ontario. Whether we are fishing the current breaks of the Nipigon River or the rocky points of the big lake, "Nipigon Gold" is always on the menu.

## Where We Find Them
* **The River System:** We target Walleye in the eddies and current seams. These fish are strong "river-run" fighters that use the flow to their advantage.
* **Lake Nipigon:** Here, we find massive schools of Walleye on offshore humps and weedy flats. These fish tend to be darker in color and very aggressive.

## Tactics: Finesse meets Function
1. **Jigging the Current:** The classic 1/4 or 3/8 oz jig tipped with a minnow or a soft plastic paddletail. We focus on the "slow water" just off the main current.
2. **Back-Trolling:** On the lake, we often use bottom bouncers and worm harnesses to cover ground and locate active schools on the transition lines.

> **The Ultimate Reward:** Nothing beats a **Nipigon Shore Lunch**. If the conditions allow, we'll take a few "eater" sized fish (15-18 inches) and prepare them fresh on the rocks.
