# The Grey Ghosts: Lake Trout of Lake Nipigon

If the Brook Trout is the king of the river, the **Lake Trout** (*Salvelinus namaycush*) is the undisputed master of the depths. In Lake Nipigon and the North Shore of Superior, these "Grey Ghosts" reach sizes that challenge your gear and your endurance.

## What Makes Nipigon Lake Trout Unique?

Lake Nipigon is one of the most productive Lake Trout fisheries in North America. Unlike many inland lakes where 10-pounders are a rarity, here, a **20-pound fish** is a regular occurrence, and 40-pound giants are always a possibility.

### The "Shadow Hunter" Behavior
* **The Shallow Window (May-June):** Immediately after ice-out, Lake Trout roam the surface and rocky shorelines in search of warmer water. This is a dream for the casting angler—heavy spoons or large shallow-running crankbaits can result in explosive strikes in less than 10 feet of water.
* **The Summer Deep-Dive (July-August):** As the water warms, the giants retreat to the "refrigerator" below the thermocline (60–100+ feet). This is where our **Humminbird electronics** become our best friend, allowing us to vertical jig with heavy plastics or spoons right on their noses.

## Tactics for Success

### 1. Vertical Jigging
There is nothing like the "thump" of a Lake Trout hitting a 1.5-oz jig in 80 feet of water. We use heavy-action **St. Croix rods** and braided line to ensure we have the sensitivity to feel the subtle take and the backbone to bring them up from the abyss.

### 2. Casting the Shoals
In early June, we target rocky points and saddles. A **Williams Wabler** or a **Blue Fox Pixee** spoon cast into the wind often produces the most aggressive bites of the season.

### 3. Conservation First
These fish are slow-growing. A 30-inch Lake Trout can be over 20 years old. While we love a fresh trout dinner, we promote the release of all "Trophy" class fish to ensure the genetics of the Nipigon giants stay in the lake.

## Best Time to Book
* **Peak Numbers:** Late May through June (Shallow water casting).
* **Peak Size:** July and August (Deep water jigging).
* **Late Season:** September, as they begin to move toward the shoals for the fall spawn.
