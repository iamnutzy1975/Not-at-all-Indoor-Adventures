# North Shore Steelhead: Chrome in the Current

On the North Shore of Lake Superior, the **Steelhead** (migratory Rainbow Trout) is the ultimate prize for the river angler. These are powerful, acrobatic fish that spend their lives in the cold depths of Superior before returning to the Nipigon-area tributaries to spawn.

## The Seasonal Runs
* **The Spring Run (April - June):** This is the main event. As the ice breaks, the Steelhead enter the rivers. This is high-energy fishing, often in cold, high-water conditions where "chrome" fish are fresh from the lake.
* **The Fall Run (October - November):** A smaller but legendary run of fish follows the salmon into the rivers to feast on eggs. These fish are often at their strongest and most colorful.

## How We Target Them
1. **Float Fishing:** Using long rods and centerpin or spinning reels to achieve a perfect "dead drift" with beads, roe, or jigs under a float.
2. **Fly Fishing:** Swinging streamers or dead-drifting nymphs through the deep pools and tail-outs of the Nipigon tributaries.

> **Conservation Note:** Our North Shore Steelhead are a precious resource. We practice careful handling and prioritize the release of wild spawning fish to ensure the future of the run.
