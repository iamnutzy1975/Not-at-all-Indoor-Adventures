# Nipigon Fishing Reports: 2026 Season

**February 10, 2026: Mid-Winter Update**
The ice on Lake Nipigon is currently stable. We are seeing a strong bite for Whitefish and Lake Trout in 80 feet of water. 

**Upcoming:** We are currently booking for the **May Ice-Out**, which is the prime window for shallow-water Lake Trout casting. If you want to see a 20lb fish follow your lure to the boat, this is your week.
